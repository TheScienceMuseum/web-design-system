Use to create areas of vibrant brand expression.

If you have a great image to work with, there is no need to add a gradient.
However when brand is the key communication, a gradient-only design may be the most appropriate solution.

Css-generated gradients can be two or three colours.
Always use colours that are contiguous on the colour wheel.
To add a gradients as a background colour, you can add the utility class, e.g.

```
 <div class="u-grad-red-orange">
```

Or you can add use the scss mixin, e.g.

```
@include sm-gradient($c-green $c-teal $c-blue);
```
