title: "Science Museum Group: Web Design System"
---

## What is this?

The Web Design System shows visual examples of all the elements that make up the Science Museum Group's websites, along with reference code for their implementation. The aim is to maintain brand consistency across all the sites, and as a toolbox to help develop sites quickly without reinventing any wheels.

## Who is this for?

Anyone who is designing or developing a website for the Science Museum Group. Even if you don't need to use these components directly, the documentation should be a useful reference for how we have done stuff elsewhere

## How do I use it?

Read the documentation section, then see [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) for how to integrate it into your project.
