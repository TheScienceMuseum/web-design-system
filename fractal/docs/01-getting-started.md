# How to use this

### To import source Scss and js into another project:

```
npm install thesciencemuseum/xxx
```

then import the relevant modules into js and scss

> [is there a required base/core, and modularised?]

### To use the compiled css/js

> this will mean you can't customise e.g. theme colours, but it might be adequate in some circumstances, or for simpler uses

Add a link to the compiled version via unpkg.io (or SMG cdn?)
