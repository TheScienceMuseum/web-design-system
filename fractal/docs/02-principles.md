title: OUR COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES
---

> This stuff is straight out of the brand guidelines, but should be relevant here too.

## ALWAYS INFORMATIVE

We communicate with purpose, sharing our stories in ways that feel relevant to our audiences. We aim to surprise and delight but don’t assume knowledge. We are open and honest when things go wrong.

## ALWAYS FRIENDLY

Our tone can be playful or formal, depending on the audience. But as welcoming museums – our voice is always warm and accessible. Our passion and knowledge will inspire our audiences, so we avoid clichés, exclamation marks.

## ALWAYS ENGAGING

We ask questions, we reveal interesting facts and we encourage our audiences to get involved. Clear and succinct, we avoid jargon, but we don’t dumb down. We focus on what our audiences can do, not what they can’t.

## ALWAYS AUTHENTIC

We are genuine and honest, never gimmicky. Everything we say is accurate and relevant. We share what we know about science, even when the subject is controversial, but we avoid expressing personal or political opinions.

# OUR DESIGN PRINCIPLES

## ALWAYS ICONIC

We design with confidence and communicate important ideas with powerful, singular design solutions.

## ALWAYS BRAVE

Like the scientist and inventors whose stories we tell, we must never settle for the expected. We look harder and explore further to uncover something new, aspirational and inspiring.

## ALWAYS COMMUNICATING

Never decoration.
We focus on the essential aspects and eliminate superfluous noise.

## ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE

We work hard to create compelling designs that make it easy for everyone to experience our inspiring content and stories.
