Further docs about _internal_ SCSS mixins and functions are available at [Sass tools](docs/sass-tools/ ?).

You'll also have use of these third party libraries:

 - [@include-media](https://include-media.com/)
 - [normalize-scss](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss)
 - [sass-between](https://github.com/tobystokes/sass-between)
 

> TODO: there might be ways to process sassdoc output into this system, but maybe more work than its worth, given that audience may differ.
