Further docs about _internal_ SCSS mixins and functions are available at [Sass tools](/docs/sass-tools/colour).

You'll also have use of these third party libraries:

- [@include-media](https://include-media.com/)
- [normalize-scss](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss)
- [sass-between](https://github.com/tobystokes/sass-between)

> TODO: Sass comments are processed from the source into markdown you see here via our special sassdoc theme, but it could be improved in terms of formatting / template. If it's actually of use to anyone...
